# me_cleaner

me_cleaner is a tool to remove as much code as possible from an Intel ME/TXE/SPS image.

It currently works on most of the architectures, see [me_cleaner status](https://github.com/corna/me_cleaner/wiki/me_cleaner-status) (or [its discussion](https://github.com/corna/me_cleaner/issues/3)) for more info about the supported architectures.

If you want to understand how me_cleaner works, you can read the ["How does it work?" page](https://github.com/corna/me_cleaner/wiki/How-does-it-work%3F).
